TWITTER mode

separate node path from columnGroups

- on first selection of 2nd column, add a back arrow to root column headerView
- on Browser.selectColumn(), if column depth < 3, remove back arrow
- on back arrow click, set node of 2nd column back one unless that would be root

-----

- collapse if not last two columns
- expand when last column again

collapse option on views? or...
option to show several levels in one column and collapse on selection? or...
use breadcrumbs (works on mobile as well)



TODAY
GOAL: send an ecrypted msg bt identities



verify gen key pairs


BUGS

- don't show post delete if it's parent is a Region?

TESTING

If post in test category, lorel ipsum it.


BASICS


- make hasSent a property of Sell
  - have Sell set editable on post somehow?


STAMPS

- calculate difficulty for category and msg size


MORE

- remove post delete action when under a sale?
- image expansion 
- image resizing (adjust jpg compression until <= size target)

EXTRA

- support encrypted message objects
- support identities

ObjectMessages with receiverId matching a local identity placed in:

[identity]/Messages

If they reference a sell thread, place in:

Identity/Sales/[sale]/Messages


--- NICE ---

- browser resets path on selection
- browser nodes support "rememberBrowserPath" and auto select and update?

--- DOC NOTES ---------

SYNCING

DB -> MODEL -> VIEW (db loads on start or model access, view loads on access)

DB <- MODEL -> VIEW (model code auto detects changes and calls sync to view and DB)

DB    MODEL <- VIEW (event code explicitly calls sync)
