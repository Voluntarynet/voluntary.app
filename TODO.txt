SINGLE COLUMN MODE BUGS


- row delete button not stopping event propagation to select row?

- CLEANUP: avoid writing over (or at least ever storing) existing object instances on read from store?
    - looks like they get stored the first pass and the ones from last time are deleted on next sweep

- fix hash path to remove first component (the app name)

- add verify delete panel

- don't adjust visible column set if a new row selection doesn't require more room (let user use back arrow if they want that)

- add right arrow on note of link field

- support elipsis in column header title

- nodeMaxWidth?

- have browserview observe node titles to update window hash path

fitColumns
  activeEndColumnsThatFitBrowserWidth
  inactiveEndColumns
  setInactiveEndColumnCount()
  startColumnsToCollapse
 

- if single column mode, use a single default column bgColor
-- add a nodeColumnTitle method which defaults to title for single column mode


- cleanup message dict format
- chat threads
- move contacts under identity
- add time/date field


- fix from address on emails 

-- CLEANUP css using new inheritance feature - e.g. declare font only on NodeView
- add a forward arrow note to PointerRowView



++ move actions to fields with attributes like "isEnabled" and enabledMethod

-- use View prefix consistently

- support hashtag for sharing a path (app will ask which id to find it under)


-----------------------------------------------------------------

- way to show pubkey when no contact available
- disable send action on draft when invalid
- add hashtag path to url
- make tab go to next field?


-----------------------

- image resizing (adjust jpg compression until <= size target)

--- DOC NOTES ---------

SYNCING

DB -> MODEL -> VIEW (db loads on start or model access, view loads on access)

DB <- MODEL -> VIEW (model code auto detects changes and calls sync to view and DB)

DB    MODEL <- VIEW (event code explicitly calls sync)

BMTweet - BMObjectMessage
BMTweetRowView (non fixed height)
