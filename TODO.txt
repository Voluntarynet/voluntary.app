SINGLE COLUMN MODE BUGS

- row delete button not stopping event propogation to select row?

- CLEANUP: avoid writing over (or at least ever storing) existing object instances on read from store?
    - looks like they get stored the first pass and the ones from last time are deleted on next sweep

- transaction support for syncDB (use 2 dicts)
- Transitions object 
    -  transition: width 2s, height 4s;
    -    transition-delay: 1s;
    - #div1 {transition-timing-function: linear;}
    - ease-in-out
    -     transition: width 2s linear 1s; 1st time is duration, 2nd time is delay

- editing too slow when lots of email message rows....

- move delete action to rows? mouse over X for desktop, swipe left for mobile?

- add verify delete panel

- don't adjust visible column set if a new row selection doesn't require more room (let user use back arrow if they want that)

- add right arrow on note of link field


- support elipsis in column header title

-- make didUpdate and Node/View specific

- nodeMaxWidth?
- support for size to fit width on columns (limit to nodeMaxWidth)


- have browserview observe node titles to update window hash path

fitColumns

  activeEndColumnsThatFitBrowserWidth
  inactiveEndColumns
  setInactiveEndColumnCount()
  startColumnsToCollapse
  
   - reverse count width of active columns up to browser width
   - if fills browser, collapse all inactive columns
   - else leave 2 last columns uncollapsed 
- always apply flex 100 to last uncollapsed column

- fix single column mode
- replace icons with unicode chars - use transform to scale if needed
- if single column mode, use a single default column bgColor

- add BrowserHeader title - use when single column
-- add a nodeColumnTitle method which defaults to title

- multi options popup overflow is hidden?

- cleanup message dict format
- chat threads
- move contacts under identity
- add time/date field


- fix from address on emails 

-- CLEANUP css using new inheritance feature - e.g. declare font only on NodeView
- add a forward arrow note to PointerRowView



++ move actions to fields with attributes like "isEnabled" and enabledMethod

-- use View prefix consistently

- support hashtag for sharing a path (app will ask which id to find it under)


-----------------------------------------------------------------

- way to show pubkey when no contact available
- disable send action on draft when invalid
- add hashtag path to url
- make tab go to next field?


-----------------------

- image resizing (adjust jpg compression until <= size target)

--- DOC NOTES ---------

SYNCING

DB -> MODEL -> VIEW (db loads on start or model access, view loads on access)

DB <- MODEL -> VIEW (model code auto detects changes and calls sync to view and DB)

DB    MODEL <- VIEW (event code explicitly calls sync)

--- TWITTER NOTES ---

BMTweet - BMObjectMessage
BMTweetRowView (non fixed height)
