on setting a stored slot, check subnodes and replace old slot value with new one if found

- BMNode - add subnode sorter function, auto invoke on setSubnodes, addSubnode, etc

- Browser footer support

- support for bold on focus row?

- bug: Chat adding more thread subnodes on reload
- deal with issue of storedSlots which are also subnodes

- move BMNode storage code to BMStorableNode
- eliminate BMNavNode? still need title matching?

- make sure direct setting of _slot = value also call slotUpdate
- check for not calling setParentNode on subnode that already has a parent???

--- DOC NOTES ---------

SYNCING

DB -> MODEL -> VIEW (db loads on start or model access, view loads on access)
DB <- MODEL -> VIEW (model code auto detects changes and calls sync to view and DB)
DB    MODEL <- VIEW (event code explicitly calls sync)
