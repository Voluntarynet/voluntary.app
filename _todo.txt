TODO:

	- support accepts subnode drop onto link node
	
	Notes: 
	Underlying datastructure for Hypercard and spreadsheets, are tables.
	Hypercard has customized row editors and is focused on search, 
	while spreadsheets are focused on calculation. 
	
	
	tap-tap-hold drag to copy vs 
	tap-hold drag to move
	 
	Self?

	Way to drag selection for copy (vs move)
	
	Prototypes
		- Primitives
		- 3rd Party
		- Custom
		
	Have CreatorNode add prototypes to list?
	
	Have row.desiredWidth include subtitle?
	add inspector to choose how row desiredWidth calculated - use elipsis if title/subtitle cut off 
	
	DateNode needs inspector & fix weird subnodes - are they being stored?
		- set year range
		- option to display age?
		- options on subtitle stuff
	
	replace node label slots with title overrides?

	have reorder cause parent nodes to re-render
	
	PointerField vs LinkNode?
	
	Row delete X in wrong position?
	
	Prototypes node

	disable row view gestures while any Text is being edited

	unify node->view sync and node->store sync?
	
	ActorNode?

	work on shouldStoreSubnodes - need to override this on a per class (or per instance) basis for
	nodes like BMDateField
	
	simplify getter/setter hooks?

	If a lazy ref can be on a network store, should we move to supporting
	fully async local store too?
		- we have finalize and loadFinalize, but we'll need more ways of 
		making upper level looks into lower level async?
	Better to make remote store fully synchronous for now.
	

	get drag in/out of browser copy working again
	
	unify willGetSlotName by moving it into Slot? remove from ProtoClass

	//add name caching for willGetSlot, didGetSlotName
	make sure all _privateName = are preceeded by instance init that calls defineSlot
	
	move detect (and other map ops) to use undefined where more appropriate than null

	Update Volunutary site to say project is on hold.
	Move Notepad repo.
	Come up with Notepad/Sketchpad name
     
	have SlotGroup which manages privateName, getter, and setter?
	move Slot/slots into base Object? How to ensure init is called? Do we want it called on all Arrays, etc?
	
	
	
	add shouldSelfTest to Object prototype to support runnign all tests?
	
	FINALIZATION

		// called on all objects
		- scheduleFinalize // Object just calls finalize(), BMNode schedules finalize
		- finalize

		- didLoadFromStore

		- scheduleLoadFinalize
		- loadFinalize
		
		
	CONSIDER
	support unloading lazy references? Subnodes array should only ever be 
	referenced by owner node, so it's always safe to unload it
	how to remove from activeObjects unless we can be sure no references are held?
	Store.activeObjectsReferencingObject(anObject), using refPids
	BMNode.unloadSubnodesIfPossible
	
	
	TIMESTAMPS
	every record has write ts/timeStamp? Should ts be stored in object or is it store dependent?
	Hold ts only in record. Ask store for *it's* ts for a record.

	change semantics of willGetSlot etc to pass slot instead of slot name
	
	RANDOM proxy rebroadcaster? posts any message sent to it (supports list of valid messages?)

 cleanup prepare for first access
	
	OPTIMIZATION
	- move creation of unhooked_ slots to Array 
	- and implement it's methods using unhooked methods with calls to will+didMutate?
	- implement a doMutation(aClosure) that pauses mutation callbacks and calls will/didMutate?

	ELEGANCE
	- cleaner way to handle lazySubnodesCount?
		- have storeRef able to access Record properties?
		- Array.lengthForRecord(this.slotNamed("subnodes").storeRef().record())?
		
	FEATURES
	Slot type checking setTypeCheck(aClassName)
	- copy slots?
	
	
	- remove old BMNode sorting code
	- with BMNode subnode observer, no longer need didChangeSubnodeList calls?
	
	- merge BMFieldSetNode with BMNode?
	
	- find how Theme and other stuff is getting into Storage

	- work on didUpdateNode notifications - coalesce?

	- asReadOnly method on array with returns ReadOnlyArray Copy
	bug: row title / subtitle are sometimes clipped
	
	take a close look at .overrideSlot() calls
	replace "delete a[i]" with a.removeAt(i)
	replace "a[i] = v" with atPut(i, v)

	- replace old subnode hooks? 
		- have subnodes array notify node of mutation?
		- needed to notify views?
			
	- fix reordering via drag and drop
			
	- review this.overrideSlot("title"...

	- have auto getter/setters check and call super?

	change use of "slot" to mean Slot object and replace other uses (e.g. newSlots) with "property"
	
	need to add stored field in initPrototype and then instantiate it in init?

	
	Field issues:
	
		- initPrototype
			- add slot
				- set to shouldStore
				- set initInstance // fields aren't an initInstance - the value is stored in the slot, field is a subnode
					- init and setup Field
		- init
			- Slot.onInstanceInitSlot
				- init new instance of field
				- add new instance as subnode ???
		
	

	Change Observation target to sender
	
	mode onDidEditNode and other parent messages to have parents listen to subnodes
	
	ConstructorA
		.prototype -> PrototypeA
						constructor -> ConstructorA
						__proto__ -> Object?
						slots =
						
	
	
	- add store check to make sure only one commit is done per event loop?
				
	cleanup shared to use typeClass
	
	NodeStore:
		Remove global _ roots and replace with a single root Node.
	
	BMNode
		- need to support array and dict values on slots which can reference nodes
		  so we can implement Store.pidRefsFromNodeDict
		
		- differences between copy and store?

	- fix for BooleanFieldView tab action
	
	dragging
		issues:
			- interfering with gestures
		solution:
			- require special key (C?) to turn on BrowserRow drag out of browser? 
				- turn on listen to keyboard
					- on_C_KeyDown, turn on register for dragging
					- on_C_KeyUp, turn off dragging
		
	
	copying
	- would be nice to unify store, copy, drag-to-json
		issues:
		- what about auto scheduling sync to NodeStore (only do this on StorableNode?)
	

	BrowserColumn.onDragDestinationDropped
	- change to insert dropped node and sync instead of inserting view and syncing to node? 

	add canCopy option?

	support copy and link drag
	
	long press + option = two finger long press?
	- mapping of certain keys to more fingers?
	
	copying an object
	
	StorableNode -> SummaryNode -> MenuNode
                                   OptionsNode
								   
								   
	- way to present errors in summary (set a message on top node that's presented if any lower nodes have error)
	- way to clear values in all lower nodes
	- top node default message for all lower nodes cleared?
	
	
	Prototypes
	- way to link a top node to it's prototype
	- special stored property BMStorableNode.viewPrototype
								  	
	
	
	should text fields be html?
	
	
	- Inspector 
		- have view inform node when it can stop caching inspector node?
		- some form of retain/release?
		- ask NotificationCenter if anyone is watching?
		- have NotificationCenter send message when watch count goes to zero?
		
	- ComputedValueNode
		- can type equation that can access sibiling or parent slots for variables
		
	- OptionNode
		- if single selection jump back on activing
	- TextNode store isSelectable
		- MenuNode store wantsRestOfWidth or wantsFillWidth?

	- bug: undefined showing up for notes in Peer app
	- bug row content view 1px less height than row?
	
	- how to use nodes for viewStyles? Color?
		- ISSUE: both nodes and views need view styles
		- ISSUE: loop: viewStyle node needs a viewStyle
		- SOLUTION: like Nodes can have inspectors - create on access?
		- NOTE: have viewStyles which can point to others for inheritance?
		
	- separate views from rows and drop them into row contentView?

    Drag/Drop Protocol

        TODO
            - automate Node scheduleSyncToStore instead of making views responsible?
            - look into "selectThisColumn WARNING: this.browser() === null"
            - don't allow views to change node?
            
        BUG
        
            - do we need to syncFromNode for all tellParentViews("didEditNode")?
                - was this from before didUpdateNode notifications?
                - probably can stop at first level responsible for syncing with node?
            
        - navigate left when holding over left side?

        - finish dragging operation type support (link, copy, move)

                source // view from which the drag item is coming (implements dragging source protocol)
                destinationView (set before completion)
                
            - have dragging view set a sourceView on DraggingView (usually it's parent)
            - send different messages to sourceView than other hoverViews
            
            
            Responsibilities:
            
                item:
                    - get long press that starts drag

                destination/hover Views
                
                    if it just needs to react to hover (e.g. row):
                        - selects self
                    
                    if it accepts drop (e.g. column): 
                        - open place holder on enter 
                        - move placeholder on hover

- demo for making diagrams
    DiagramView
    
    
- add 
    - a just text area row
    - title row?

- replace Win/Window point APIs with Viewport? Move all to Document points?
    - have EventPoint use document(?) coordinates and implement asViewPortPoint, asDocumentPoint, asPointInView(aView)

Bugs:
    - source row reappears in source when dragged over not drop area
    
    - row moving during placeholder index change isn't covering row width
    - long-click drag is causing text selections
        - google it - how to override click drag? stop propogation of click?
        - keep selection of until tap?


        
        
BrowserRow hover
    - nice animations
        - animate placeholder creation if the column isn't the drag source
        - shrink placeholder to zero if drag is over middle third of a row (that we can drop on?)
        - animate close of source placeholder after drop
        - animate return of dragView to original column on drop cancel?
    
    - how to deal with multiple hover targets that accept drag
    - detect if drag view is on far left/right of browser columns with more columns and back/forward if held there
    
    
Browser
    - support multi-touch, shift-click, and shift-click-drag multi-selection
        - prevent selection nav when doing multi-selection
    - apply long press to whole multi-selection
        - special dragView for multi-selection
    - advanced: support pinch on multi-selection to auto create menu and move selection into it



Inspector
    - test out inspectors on other elements - fields like "shows title"

- make CloseButton a subclass of ButtonView

- cleanup uses of onTapComplete? support onOneFingerTap, onOneFingerDoubleTap, etc?

- event propogation for gestures - separate onTap from onAlternateTap?

need a way to set icon forground colors

turn off arrow key handling by column while editing text field

issue with tap - what if a parent and child view both get a tap?
- how do we implement an event propogation system like click uses?
- option: have request activation check to see if the currently activated view is under the requesting on,
  if so, override it?

BrowserRow title - TextField option for double tap to edit?

MIRROR
Do we need inheritance?

View

- nodeMirror() { 
    const node = this._node
    if (node && node.nodeMirror) {
        return node.nodeMirror()
    }
    return node
}
    

nodeMirror()

- select BMFieldViewRow when clicking on it

- make BrowserRow note view vertically centered

nodeRowLink -> nodeRowLinkMethods?
defaultNodeRowLinkMethod?
notification didUpdateDodeRowLinkMethods

OPTION 0
Keep columns unaware that a node was skipped?


OPTION 1
Let the node manage what the column sees?
Row (for NodeA) -> select -> Column (for NodeA)
Row (for NodeA) -> select -> Column (for NodeA.visibleNode())

OPTION 2
Let the column manage what the column sees?
Row (for NodeA) -> select -> Column (for NodeA)
Row (for NodeA) -> select -> Column (for NodeA.visibleNodesOrder()[index])

OPTION 3
Use compacted column to jump?
Node 
- columnCompactsByDefault()
- compactedColumnDefaultSelectedSubnode()

NodeA.defaultColumnNode() (this or some subnode?)

1. advantages - keeps logic on view side
                expand animatations 
                have special button or gesture on row to "uncompact" subnodes
                keeps paths consistent
                
2. disadvantages - need to make Columns navigation aware when it should skip the compacted columns

Will most nodes be "compacted"?
Can we skip creating that view entirely? If so, just special case paths?

Node -> NodeView

A Field is a Node that represents a Slot.
A Slot has key, value, and other properties (canEdit, valid values, validator, etc)

Field 
    key / isVisible / isEditable / error
    value / isVisible / isEditable / error
    isValid
    target
    valueSetter
    valueGetter

A Field is a Row that is a container for a 


Move from .node() to nodeMirror() ?


NODES -> RowViews

Action 
Boolean
Date
Image
Menu (title, subtitle)
Number (range, format, useSlider?) 
Options 
Pointer
TextField
TextArea
Color

-----------

**Fields**
- make statefull and have them sync with parent nodes if they have targetGetter/setters (Done?)
BMOptionRow - sends this.parentNode().selectOption(this) when clicked

- a row duplicate feature? (command D? command copy/paste? three finger long press?)

- mode for non white background on fields - persist styles?

- add a default user image, so formatting of messages isn't weird 

- use onShiftClick and two finger long press to inspect a node?

---------------

use control-edge drag or double finger drag to apply to prototype?
store width hint on parent node's field?

abstract edge drag to resize?

gesture to add subtitle?


should we abstract style so we can:
- unify style and computed style
- simplify storing and copying style
- separate style specific helpers (e.g. PX stuff) from DomView 

need generic way to open an inspector for currently focused item?
e.g. inspect TextField currently editing to change font size
- multi-finger long tap on touch? function-click with mouse?

protocol to check editability of and store adjusted row size, font size, etc?
option +, option - to adjust font size of text field being edited
change font color, bg color, column color settings
column orientation

copy/paste style
store/edit style at row prototype level

dynamically add field rows?
- option-long-click / double-long-press to inspect element to choose field type?

    Node
        - fields
        - subnodes (short cuts to an array field
        
    A field is a type of node used to represent a property of a node.
    
    Field types:
        Creator     BMCreatorField
        Button      BMActionNode
        Boolean     BMBooleanField  
        Date        BMDateField
        Text 
        TextArea    BMTextAreaField
        Identity    BMIdentityField
        Number      BMNumberField
        Time
        Options (can point to node containing list of options, or it's own local set?)
        Pointer
        Array
        Method?
        
        
prevent onClick when finishing row reording

fix row background /transparent issues

Transitions abstraction work

	- standard long press with 2-3 fingers to drag?
	- ask if target allows drag
	- determine type of drag (move/copy) using modifier keys and or finger count?
	- determine how to display drag view - some common standard of icon + label?
	- create drag view and add to DocumentBody(?)

    Browser features:  
        - copy/paste on rows?
        - double tap to inline edit row text?
        - pinch apart to add row?
        - tap on column to add row?
        - stretch to add row?

    How to expand/compact Node to edit properties?
      - icons at top? gesture? 
         - hold click on top? 
         - hold click on column divider?
         - horizontal pinch apart columns - pinch together to compact?  
         - how to visually display option to edit?

    TopShelf vs LeftShelf? TopDragShelf?
    - compact/expand top shelf?

    Small fixes:
    - figure out when to use white/dark theme on rows consistently
    - use dark for non property navigation?

    Editing a Node:
    - when adding row, insert a special place-holder row and navigate into it
      next column shows options for which type of row to add, navigate to choice
      further options and "ok" displayed to complete action?
    - how to edit an existing row? special click to navigate to it's options?

    - some way to collapse/expand Node to show all properties or treat some default as it's subnodes? 

    Questions:
    - How to distinguish meta edit operations? 
    - When is it normal or meta?
