# DEVELOPER OVERVIEW

This project is a set of frameworks and an application for an in-browser webRTC-based secure p2p messaging app platform.

This project includes:

- an in-browser webRTC-based decentralized messaging platform 
- a desktop-like (e.g. AppKit) UI framework in which apps can be built with no templates or html
- a Miller column based scalable, reactive common UI system which automatically works on desktop, tablets and phones
- a naked objects framework which can generate a UI based on model objects (most apps require no UI code)
- an intergrated client-side transparent persistence framework (most apps require developer to declare stored objects and fields)
- a notifications system which automatically synchronizes the UI, model, and persistence

On top of this system, decentralized apps (dapps) can quicky be built with very little code. 
A decentralized Twitter app is included as an example.



## History

This app started as a port of [Bitmarkets](https://voluntary.net/bitmarkets/) Objective-C/OSX implementation to Electron/JS.
