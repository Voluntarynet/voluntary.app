UI FRAMEWORKS

The app is built on integrated naked objects UI and transparent persistence database frameworks. 
These allow the developer to add new model objects without the need to write (almost) any code to interface these objects to the UI or database. 

HOW TO USE

Model level objects should subclass the BMNode class. 
If the object will need to persist itself, it should subclass BMStorableNode.
