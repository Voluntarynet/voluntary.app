IMPORT SYSTEM

INDEX.HTML

The importing system handles all javascript and css loading. 
The index.html file only needs to contain:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="src/boot/LoadProgressBar.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="src/boot/JSImporter.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body id="body"></body>
    </html>


And the importing system will take care of the rest. 
Imports are declares in _imports.js file in each folder which should declare 
the resources to be loaded in that folder, and any subfolder in which there is a _imports.js folder.

ORDERING

Loading order is the same as declaration order.

Sample _imports.js file:

	JSImporter.pushRelativePaths([
		"_css.css", 
		"external_libs/_imports.js",
		"data/_imports.js",
		"src/_imports.js",
		"MyApp.js",
	])
	
The paths in each _imports.js file are relative to the folder it is found within.

If you need to call some initialization functions after everything is loaded, 
you can call JSImporter.pushDoneCallback() in the related folder's _imports.js

    JSImporter.pushDoneCallback( () => {
        sjcl.random.startCollectors();
    })
