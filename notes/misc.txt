need to store Applets but don't want to store all items

on write, ignore items with rule:
- ignore items that aren't BMStorableNode? show WARNING?
- ignore items with shouldStore == false (null is default)

on read, add items in didLoadFromStore?
- read only happens on initial load of instance
- does store load overwrite all items?
  this.items().insertAfter(item, this.someItem())

rendezvous servers (need a static IP)

- peer names peerPubkey-bloomFilterOfContactPubkeys
- server can filter peer list sent to peer by union of bloom filters

- peers filter inv messages to peers so senders match bloom filter
