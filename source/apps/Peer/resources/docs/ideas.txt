IDEAS

ClassManager
    - use with class browser
    - support weak link instance browser?
    
unifying fields with normal browsing:
always present a node field set in the browser but collapse it be default and select it's default subnodes pointer field

applets:
use javascript with()+proxies to implement sandboxes

messages:
unify forum messages, posts and direct messages with optional target field (needed for forums anyways)

move css files to json
    - allow control-click on DivStyleViews to modify attributes?
    - would this allow move to import()? Issues: namespaces?
    - ability to intropect CSS, auto convert to JS?

documentation:
    - build editable documentation into app
    - support user created docs, shared via network
    


----------------------------

have browserview use defaultRowStyles
defaultColumnStyles

- set svg color to match textColor of row?

- add multi marker support?
- need delete button for user (in shelf?)
- verify panel
- select last selected node on shelf on appDidInit

- integrate shelf with columns?
    - separate column didClickRow(aRow) and addColumnForNode(aNode)
    - add BrowserExpandableRow
    - add way for node to request top toolbar color
        - use white versions of tool icons if background is dark
            - write a CSSColor class to calc brightness

- select new user profile after creating it (animate it?)
- always use column titles if only one column is displayed (which may not be in single column mode)

- badges for shelf icons! A feature of imageView?

- add user button
- pinned compose button that applies to currently open lid, pinned settings gear?

- adjust zoom to match normal Twitter client on desktop but be larger on mobile if possible
- add settings gear shelf item, link to about

- find a way to switch between shelf/non-shelf modes
- add an "expires in X days" to post row view? Don't expire if liked/reposted/replied?

- logic for reply, repost, like
- reverse feed/posts ordering and insert new items at 0
- add a group shelf item for contacts
- set default path for shelf
- add notifications folder (add replies, reposts here when adding to feed?)
- add icons to chat bubbles, chat thread titles
- search folder

- send a post - draft creates post, sends it, adds it to myposts, deletes draft
- handle a post - place in feed

- change selection color for drafts?
- delete button for post drafts
- delete button for my posts
- LikePostMessage 
- replyTo:hash and repostOf:msgObj attributes for PostMessage

- search?

Avoid full path reselect if possible with Browser.selectNode()


Rendezvous server
	- flooding of addresses among everyone
	- only share an address you've verified

Public and direct messages
	- flooding of messages between sender and sender's followers

Not hidden:
	- my IP
	- my pubkey identities
	- my following pubkeys list
	- public feed posts
	- public "find me at these rendezvous server" messages
	
hidden:
	- content and recipient (recipient among mutual following) is hidden to all but sender and receiver 
	- sender, size of content and timestamp is visible to friends
	- packet sizes, bandwidth between friends visible to 
	
	

visibly only to sender and receiver:
	content of direct messages
	recipient of direct messages
	
visible to friend network:
	sender X sent message with encrypted content of size Y at time T (recipient unknown)
	
exchange of messages between peers is encrypted so only receiver can receive it
pubkey receiving the connection sends an sync encryption key encrypted so only other pubkey can read it
other pubkey must send messages on this connection using that key

visible to passive network observer:

    store <- node -> view
    
    node scheduleSyncToStore    store <- node
    node scheduleSyncToView     node -> view (just requests that view sync from it)
    view scheduleSyncFromNode   node -> view
    view scheduleSyncToNode     node <- view
    
    - model to store (any storable set slot outside of loading)
    - model to view (any viewable set slot)
    - view to model (any modelled set slot during user input? timers?)


--------

ChatMsg
    -> ObjMsgRecord 
        -> ObjMsg
   
DB LOST IDS:     
    - can produce by throwing exception in PrivateMessage setObjMsg (which is raised when loading first time)
    - can produce sometimes with error on imports 

    
- ImageWellView
    - insert dropped image between images at drop point instead of appending to end
    
TODO: add way to access style sheet attribute of a given css class e.g. BrowserFooter height

- put column header actions in separate view so they can be synced separately 

- ChatThread - only select from valid remoteIdentities? Color/Mark invalid RemoteIdentities

on setting a stored slot, check subnodes and replace old slot value with new one if found

- eliminate BMNavNode? still need title matching?

- make sure direct setting of _slot = value also call slotUpdate
- check for not calling setParentNode on subnode that already has a parent???

GENERAL 
    - add navigator.onLine check?

--- DOC NOTES ---------

SYNCING

DB -> MODEL -> VIEW (db loads on start or model access, view loads on access)
DB <- MODEL -> VIEW (model code auto detects changes and calls sync to view and DB)
DB    MODEL <- VIEW (event code explicitly calls sync)
